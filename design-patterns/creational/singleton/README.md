# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to this instance. It is commonly used in scenarios where system-wide action needs to be coordinated from a single central place. Examples include configurations, thread pools, caches, dialog boxes, and more.

## Implementation in TypeScript

The implementation in this folder demonstrates the Singleton pattern in TypeScript. The key aspect of this implementation is ensuring that the Singleton class cannot be instantiated from outside the class itself, while still providing a globally accessible instance.

## Usage

The Singleton pattern can be particularly useful in situations where you need to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, when managing a connection to a database or a file system.

## Code Example

```typescript
// Singleton.ts

class Singleton {
    private static instance: Singleton;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private constructor() {}

    // Method for getting the instance of the Singleton
    public static getInstance(): Singleton {
        if (!Singleton.instance) {
            Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return Singleton.instance;
    }

    public someBusinessLogic() {
        // Implementation of some business logic which can be accessed via the Singleton instance
    }
}

export default Singleton;

```

## Benefits of Singleton

- **Controlled access to sole instance**: Since the instantiation is restricted, it helps in controlling the access to the instance.
- **Reduced memory footprint**: It only creates one instance, thus reducing the memory footprint.
- **Flexibility**: The pattern allows implementing changes easily; modifying the Singleton affects all clients that use the instance.
